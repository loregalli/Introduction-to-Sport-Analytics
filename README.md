# 🏃‍♂️📊 Introduction to Sport Analytics

This project is part of **Digicamp 2025**, co-teached alongside Amedeo Zappulla, where students are introduced to the fundamentals of **data science applied to sports performance**.

The focus is on **race data analysis**, teaching students how to clean, visualize, and interpret performance trends, and finally build a **basic predictive model**.

## 🎯 Goal of the Course
By the end of this course, students were able to:

- Understand the role of **data analytics in sports**.  
- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing** on raw race data.  
- Create meaningful **visualizations** to highlight performance trends.  
- Apply **basic statistical and machine learning techniques** to predict outcomes.  
- Communicate insights effectively using **plots and metrics**.

## 🏅 Use Case: Track & Field
We worked with **track & field race results** (e.g., 100m sprint times). Students explored questions such as:

- How has an athlete’s performance changed over time?  
- What trends can we identify in seasonal performance?  
- Can we predict the outcome of a future race using past results?  

## 💻 Tools
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – building simple predictive models  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – interactive analysis
